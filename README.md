- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LenYx24, or just LenY, a computer science student enrolled at BME university
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of fields related to IT, like web development, AI, game development and much more...
- ğŸŒ± I like to experiment in bleeding edge tech and play around with it, currently I was checking out the t3 stack and Next.js 13.
