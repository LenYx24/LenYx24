- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LenYx24, or just LenY, a computer engineering student enrolled at BUTE university
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of fields related to IT, like web dev, AI, game dev and much more...
- ğŸŒ± I like to experiment in new tech and play around with it, currently I was checking out the t3 stack and Next.js 13.
I focus more on C and C++ now, because of university courses, used SDL2 to make games.
